# Midnight Commander Clone

This repository contains my first major project in C#, where I aimed to recreate the functionality of the popular file manager, Midnight Commander. The project is built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and provides a user-friendly interface for navigating and managing files and directories.

## Features

- Dual-Pane File Manager: The application provides a dual-pane interface, allowing users to browse and manage files and directories simultaneously.
- File Operations: Users can perform various file operations, such as copying, moving, deleting, renaming, and creating new files and directories.
- Navigation and Selection: The project enables easy navigation through directories and selection of files for performing operations.

## Technologies Used

- C#: The project is developed using C#, a powerful and versatile programming language for building robust applications.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The application follows OOP principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase.
- File System Manipulation: The project leverages built-in file system APIs to perform file and directory operations.
- Keyboard Input Handling: The application utilizes keyboard input handling to support efficient navigation and operation execution.

## Getting Started

To run the Midnight Commander clone locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor that supports C# development.
3. Build the project and run the application to launch the Midnight Commander clone.
5. Explore the interface, navigate through directories, and perform various file operations.

## Usage

1. Use the arrow keys or the mouse to navigate through the directory structure displayed in both panes.
2. Select files or directories by highlighting them in the interface.
3. Use the available commands or keyboard shortcuts to perform operations like copy, move, delete, rename, or create new files and directories.
